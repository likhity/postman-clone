# postman-clone

Very simple clone of postman I created.

Trying to actually use this might be a bit painful since editing the body of your request is kind of difficult. There is no fancy code editor functionality in that textarea.

You can use tab to indent in the body textarea, but that part is still kind of jank.

To use the application, clone the project, run npm install, and then run npm start.

Click on the link that the parcel bundler provides in the terminal and that should open up the browser.
