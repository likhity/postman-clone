# Postman Clone

Very simple clone of postman I created.

Trying to actually use this might be a bit painful since editing the body of your request is kind of difficult. There is no fancy code editor functionality in that `<textarea>`.

You can use tab to indent in the body textarea, but that part is still kind of jank.

## How to Use

To use the application, go to <a href="https://likhity.github.io/webdev/postman-clone">likhity.github.io/webdev/postman-clone</a>.

If you want to use it your computer with all the code downloaded, run the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/likhity/postman-clone.git
cd postman-clone
npm i
npm start
```

Click on the link that the parcel bundler provides in the terminal (usually <a href="http://localhost:1234">localhost:1234</a>) and that should open up the application in the browser.
